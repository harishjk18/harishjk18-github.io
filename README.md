## [Project 1: Credit EDA case study](https://github.com/harishjk18/credit-eda-case-study)

- Our aim is to give us an idea of applying EDA in a business scenario. 
- In this case study, apart from applying the techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial   services and understand 
- This helps to find how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## [Project 2: Clustering](https://github.com/harishjk18/Clustering-Help_International)

- Start off with the necessary data inspection and EDA tasks suitable for this dataset - data cleaning, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis etc.
- Outlier Analysis
- Trying both K-means and Hierarchical clustering(both single and complete linkage) on this dataset to create the clusters. 
- Analyse the clusters and identify the ones which are in dire need of aid and differentiate the clusters of developed countries from the clusters of under-developed countries.
