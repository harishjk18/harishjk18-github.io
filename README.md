## Project 1: Credit EDA case study

- Our aim is to give us an idea of applying EDA in a business scenario. 
- In this case study, apart from applying the techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial   services and understand 
- This helps to find how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
