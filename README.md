## [Project 1: Credit EDA case study](https://github.com/harishjk18/credit-eda-case-study)

- Our aim is to give us an idea of applying EDA in a business scenario. 
- In this case study, apart from applying the techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial   services and understand 
- This helps to find how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## [Project 2: Clustering](https://github.com/harishjk18/Clustering-Help_International)

- Start off with the necessary data inspection and EDA tasks suitable for this dataset - data cleaning, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis etc.
- Outlier Analysis
- Trying both K-means and Hierarchical clustering(both single and complete linkage) on this dataset to create the clusters. 
- Analyse the clusters and identify the ones which are in dire need of aid and differentiate the clusters of developed countries from the clusters of under-developed countries.

## [Project 3: House Price Prediction using MLR](https://github.com/harishjk18/Multiple_LinearReg-House-price)

- A real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of properties in the Delhi region.
- Use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.
- To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
- To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.

## [Project 4: Sales Lead scoring by Logistic Regression](https://github.com/harishjk18/Logistic_reg-Lead_scoring)

- Built a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. 
- A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted. 
- Our model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future. 

## [Project 5: Telecom Churn Prediction](https://github.com/harishjk18/telecom-churn)

- To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
- In this project, we will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm. 
- Build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

## [Project 6: Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/harishjk18/time-series-forecasting)

- Lets develop a Time series forecasting model for an airline company
- An airline company has the data of the number of passengers that have travelled with them on a particular route for the past few years. 
- Using this data, they want to see if they can forecast the number of passengers for the next twelve months.

## [Project 7: Demands for a Bike sharing rental](https://github.com/harishjk18/telecom-churn)

- Built a Multiple Linear Regression model using RFE method to help in boosting to find the key areas of demand for a bike sharing company.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
- The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.

## [Project 8: Credit Card Fraud detection](https://github.com/harishjk18/Creditcard-fraud-detection)

- Our ultimate aim is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.
- We will analyse customer-level data that has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group.
- The data set is highly imbalanced, it needs to be handled before model building.
